The year 2023 will be special for astronomy in Indonesia: (1) the 100th birthday of its Bosscha Observatory, one of the first few large (then) observatories in the southern hemisphere. It is still a functioning observatory now and should be ready to embark on its new mission; (2) Indonesia will be fortunate to have a Total Solar Eclipse passes over its eastern part. We plan for a year of astronomy activities with various aims, including for public at large. It will be a unique time for astronomy to get attention as well as to show how it can contribute to development of civilization. This symposium strengthens the motivation to identify knowledges and skills in astronomy and astrophysics that push our contribution to saving Earth, strengthen collaborative networks that will expedite the achievement of the motivation.

The various topics in this proposed symposium cover details of science developed in astronomy and astrophysics that could be useful in investigating and understanding the Earth as part of the solar system, but also as a unique planet. This idea has inspired a number of astronomical projects around the world to invest significant portions of their projects to study Earth, which are now developing into interesting projects of their own rights. 

With the challenges in understanding various natural phenomena on Earth we currently face, it is imperative that we lend our knowledge in astronomy and astrophysics, facilities, technologies, tools, to expedite our learning of the Earth system and work together with a wider field of expertise relevant to the effort of saving our Earth. 

The reasons that make astronomy appealing to all are precisely the ones that make astronomy a good entrance to STEAM education. Astronomy is universal and inspirational, relates to all sciences, pushes technology forward, and invites people to reflect. Those reasons are woven to construct the goals of learning STEAM via astronomy, which are: (1) To raise awareness and comprehension of the physical world and natural causal relation; (2) To promote rational perception and respect towards abiotic and biotic environments, including human being; (3) To promote curiosity, knowledge, skill, creativity in STEAM; and (4) To promote positive participation and mindfulness. Those four goals resemble and emphasize the key spirit of the Sustainable Development Goals. The SOC members, representing various STEAM elements and world regions, bring in their respective expertise,  experiences, and networks, reflecting the coverage of the subtopics that embed the goals. 

The symposium will consist of plenary (invited and chosen contributed) talks, parallel contributed talks, posters, and exhibitions with fair allotted time for each. Participants who wish to show their hands-on material, apparatus, softwares, etc, are welcome to use exhibition area (must indicate the wish in the registration form).
